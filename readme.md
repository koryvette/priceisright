# THE PRICE IS RIGHT (Code Louisville project)

## Description  
In the Price is Right, there are certain games that offer a better chance of winning than others.  There are 46 seasons of the hit game show.  I analyzed the statistcs since 2000.  I stopped at 2000 because there are many games available now that were not played in the earlier years of the show.  

This data will show three things:  
* Which year that had the greatest winning percentage?  
* What game has had the highest winning percentage?  
* Which spinner in the showcase showdown was most successful?  
  
  
## Packages you will need:
* requests  
* numpy  
* sqlite3
* matplotlib
  
    
## Funtionality  
The following functionality has been added to this site:
  
* Data was saved in CSV format (https://github.com/koryvette/priceisright)
* CSV file was imported to a dataframe using Pandas/python
* A database was created called priceisright.db
* The CSV file in Python was used to create a table called Games in the priceisright.db
*   
* JQuery was also used to filter the event list  
* Form at bottom of page allows user to add an event (although not posted to database)  
* This site is also available through github/pages using the link below:  
  https://koryvette.github.io/eventcalendar
* Testing was done on the github/pages link to ensure various screen sizes and browsers were functional.
